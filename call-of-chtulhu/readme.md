# We have a new bot!
The fundamental difference is the test function, that rolls 2d10 instead of 1d20. Roll history is now a thing, further explained over each function (sparsely commented) and organized at the main readme.md

To use it, you will need two crucial files:
"players.txt" and "token.txt"

The first one should contain the name and discord ID of your players (one per line), separated by a single space.
The latter should contain just your discord token, obtainable via the Discord developer portal.

Also, for history tracking, a "success.txt" will be created, and should not be manually modified.
